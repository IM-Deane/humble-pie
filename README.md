# Description:

This is a project that I created during my studies at NAIT. Our task was to
create a multi-page website using HTML5 & CSS3.

I have decided to build upon this assignment by adding functionality to the
site's contact form.

My plan is to allow the user to submit the form, and then handle the submission
using express.js.

I will also handle any 404 errors the user may encounter.

# Version History:

_Version 1.0:_

Completed the main functionality for the site. It will now serve pages to the
user, handle form submissions, and capture all 404 errors.

_Version 0.1:_

- Created a Git repo for the project.
