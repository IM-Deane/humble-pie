# Project: Humble Pie Website

**Current Version: 1.0**

# Description: This is a project that I created during my studies at NAIT. Our task was to create a multi-page website using HTML5 & CSS3. I have decided to build upon this assignment by adding functionality to the site's contact form. My plan is to allow the user to submit the form, and then handle the submission using express.js.

# Version History:

_Version 1.0:_

Completed the main functionality for the site. It will now serve pages to the
user, handle form submissions, and capture all 404 errors.

_Version 0.1:_

- Created a Git repo for the project.
