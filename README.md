# Project: Humble Pie Website

**Current Version: 0.1**

# Description:

This is a project that I created during my studies at NAIT. Our task was to
create a multi-page website using HTML5 & CSS3.

I have decided to build upon this assignment by adding functionality to the
site's contact form.

My plan is to allow the user to submit the form, and then handle the submission
using express.js.
